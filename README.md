# MySQL_DSA_Kultra_Mega_Stores_Project
## DSA Final Project on MySQL
## üìù Project Overview
This project presents an in-depth business intelligence analysis for **Kultra Mega Stores (KMS)**, a Lagos-based retail company that specializes in office supplies and furniture. The analysis focuses on the performance of the **Abuja division** between **2009 and 2012**, using order-level data to derive actionable insights that inform strategic decisions across customer segments, product categories, and sales regions.
