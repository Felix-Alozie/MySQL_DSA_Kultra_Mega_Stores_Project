#RESPONSE: No, the company did not appropriately allocate shipping costs based on Order Priority.
#Delivery Truck, the cheapest and slowest method, is used significantly even for Critical and High orders, which contradicts priority urgency.
#Express Air, the fastest and most expensive, is used noticeably for Low and Medium priority orders, which may be an unnecessary cost.
#Regular Air, the middle ground, is heavily used across all categories, but the balance is not optimized with priority levels.
